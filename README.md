## Objectives
- Inform about the research group and its activities.
- Disseminate knowledge generated by the group.
- Encourage the participation of new members and collaborators.
- Showcase achievements and projects.
- Facilitate funding opportunities.
- Improve internal management by centralizing information.

## Website Structure
### Main Sections
- **Home:** Introduction, key achievements, recent news, upcoming events, and call-to-action.
- **Research:** Active research lines, ongoing projects, publications, and findings.
- **Training:** Workshops, research resources, and educational activities.
- **Community:** Members, Psi Chi Colombia, events, and accomplishments.
- **How to Join:** Membership process and FAQ.
- **Contact:** Contact information and interest form.
- **Gallery:** Photos of events and activities.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Platform:** Wix.com (for scalability and ease of use).

- **Design Tools:** UX/UI design software (to be determined based on needs).
- **Version Control & Documentation:** GitHub (for tracking progress, changelog, and design decisions).

## UX Methodology
### Primary Methodology: **User-Centered Design (UCD)**
This approach ensures that users are actively involved throughout the development process.
- **User Research:** Conducted through an initial survey to understand user needs.
- **Co-Design:** Users contribute ideas to define essential features and sections.
- **Prototyping:** Wireframes and layouts created in Figma to validate design choices before implementation.
- **Iterative Design:** The site evolves based on continuous feedback and usability principles.
- **Usability Testing (Pre-Launch & Post-Launch):** Testing with research group members to evaluate navigation and usability before final deployment using tools like Maze or Hotjar.

## Documentation & Transparency
- **GitHub Repository:** All progress, design decisions, and updates will be documented here.
- **Justification of Design Choices:** Captured in design_decisions.md based on UX best practices and user feedback.
- **Research Findings:** Insights from the initial survey documented in `research_findings.md`.
- **Repository Structure:** Defined in `repository_tree_structure.md` for clear organization.
- **Changelog:** Updates and improvements tracked in `changelog.md`.

## Future Enhancements
- Blog integration for content updates and member contributions.
- Membership login for internal collaboration.
- Database for research documentation.
- Improved interactivity and dynamic features if needed.
